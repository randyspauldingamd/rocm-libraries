# MIOpen Legacy Plugin - Operation Support

This document provides detailed information about the operations supported by the MIOpen Legacy Plugin for hipDNN.

For general information about hipDNN's operation support, please see the [hipDNN Operation Support](../../../docs/OperationSupport.md) documentation.

## Current Operation Support

The following table lists all operations currently supported in hipDNN:

| Operation | Datatypes | Layouts | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Batchnorm Backward  | FP16, BFP16, FP32 | NCHW, NHWC, NCDHW, NDHWC | Spatial mode only¹ |
| Batchnorm Inference + DRelu + Backward | FP16, BFP16, FP32 | NCHW, NHWC, NCDHW, NDHWC | Fused graph³ |
| Batchnorm Training  | FP16, BFP16, FP32 | NCHW, NHWC, NCDHW, NDHWC | Spatial mode only¹, No running stats⁴ |
| Batchnorm Training + Activation | FP16, BFP16, FP32 | NCHW, NHWC, NCDHW, NDHWC | Fused graph³⁴ |
| Convolution Dgrad   | FP16, BFP16, FP32 | NCHW, NHWC, NCDHW, NDHWC | Cross-correlation only² |
| Convolution Forward | FP16, BFP16, FP32 | NCHW, NHWC, NCDHW, NDHWC | Cross-correlation only² |
| Convolution Forward + (Bias) + Activation | FP16, BFP16, FP32 | NCHW, NHWC, NCDHW, NDHWC | Fused graph²³ |

## Operation Notes

> [!NOTE]
> **Batchnorm Operations:** Currently, only spatial batchnorm mode is supported. Spatial mode computes statistics over the batch (N) and spatial dimensions (H, W, or D, H, W) for each channel.

> [!NOTE]
> **Convolution Operations:** Currently, only cross-correlation convolutions are supported. True mathematical convolution (with kernel flipping) is not yet implemented. In practice, cross-correlation is the standard operation used in modern deep learning frameworks.

> [!NOTE]
> **Fused Operations:** Fused graph patterns combine multiple operations:
> - **Batchnorm Inference + DReLU + Backward:** Combines batchnorm inference, activation backward (DReLU), and batchnorm backward
> - **Batchnorm Training + Activation:** Combines batchnorm training with forward activation
> - **Convolution Forward + (Bias) + Activation:** Combines convolution forward, optional bias addition, and forward activation

> [!NOTE]
> **Activation Functions:** Supports ReLU, Clipped ReLU (with configurable upper clip), and CLAMP (with configurable lower/upper clips).

> [!NOTE]
> **Sparse Support:** All operations currently work with dense tensors only.

> [!NOTE]
> **Batchnorm Training Running Statistics:** Currently, batchnorm training only supports computing batch statistics (mean and inverse variance) without updating running statistics.

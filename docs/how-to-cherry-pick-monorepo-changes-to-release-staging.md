# How to cherry-pick monorepo changes into release-staging branches

When a project has been migrated into the ROCm monorepo, day-to-day work happens on the monorepo’s `develop` branch.  
Down-stream teams, however, still consume the original (pre-monorepo) repositories, particularly their `release-staging/rocm-rel-x.y` branches, through a variety of mechanisms.
This document explains how to move a change from the monorepo into those release-staging branches while guaranteeing that every commit on a release-staging branch also exists in the monorepo.  

## 1. Land the change in the monorepo's develop branch

1. Create a pull request in `ROCm/rocm-libraries` that targets `develop`.  
2. When merging, choose **Squash & Merge** (if the change can be represented as a single logical commit).  
   Why? A single commit is easier to cherry-pick later.

Result: The commit is now on `ROCm/rocm-libraries:develop`.

## 2. Cherry-pick into the monorepo's release-staging branch

1. Create a local branch based on the release-staging branch:

```
$ git checkout -b cherry-pick-foo-rel-x.y origin/release-staging/rocm-rel-x.y
```

2. Cherry-pick the commit:

```
$ git cherry-pick abcd1234 
```

3. Resolve any merge conflicts (rare if the branch is close to develop).
4. Push the branch and open a PR that targets `ROCm/rocm-libraries:release-staging/rocm-rel-x.y`.
5. Request reviews, obtain approvals, and merge.

## 3. Wait for the automatic “fan-out” sync

Every ~15 minutes, a CI job copies new commits from the monorepo back into the corresponding standalone repositories.

After merging your PR:

1. Monitor the CI job or simply wait ~15 minutes.  
2. Go to the original (pre-monorepo) repository and verify the commits have been reflected onto the `develop` and `release-staging/rocm-rel-x.y` branches.

## FAQ

Q : Can I cherry-pick multiple commits at once?  
A : Yes, but prefer a squash merge in the monorepo so you only need to pick one.

Q : What if the auto-sync hasn’t copied the commit?  
A : Verify the CI status in `rocm-libraries`. If failed, ask the infra team; the commit will re-sync after a successful run.

Q : Can I push directly to the release-staging branch?  
A : No. Always go through a PR so CI and reviewers can validate the cherry-pick.

Q : What if commits have been pushed to develop that make a cherry-pick incompatible with release-staging?   
A : It's likely that this fix/change will also be landed in develop at some point, else we risk divergent features/support. So, it's recommended to still land the change in develop first, and cherry-pick to release-staging, resolving any merge conflicts that arise. If for some reason the develop branch has diverged so far from the release-staging for your component that a cherry-pick is irreconcilable, land the changes in develop and release-staging using fully separate PRs, and add references to the other for traceability.

## Summary

In short:

1. Merge change to monorepo `develop`.  
2. Cherry-pick to monorepo `release-staging/rocm-rel-x.y`.  
3. Wait for the fan-out sync and verify the changes are reflected in the original repository.

Following this process keeps release branches in sync with the monorepo while allowing critical fixes to flow to down-stream consumers.
